## Abstraction
Housing price is an important aspect that reflects economic growth. Also, housing affordability is a major social and economic issue that has attracted the attention of policymakers, urban researchers and planners in many countries. There are many other factors that make house prices an important indicator to be analyzed deeply. For this project, let’s assume that the real estate company has asked you to build a pipeline so that you can predict house prices accurately. This will help them stay competitive while not losing too much profit. So, let’s get started with that.
                                               People looking for a new house tend to be more conservative towards the budget and market strategies. They always try to optimize the budget which matches their requirements and needs. Ideal home is something which fulfills and matches the customer requirement with an appropriate budget. So, price prediction is a very important thing when it comes to planning a budget. Mostly people approach a real estate manager or an agent who predicts price. This is helpful but it also increases your expense because you need to provide commission to the manager. Instead, when we have a website which predicts price for us, the time is saved and money too. It becomes easy for the customer to access it.
